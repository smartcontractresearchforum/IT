        #About Short URLs
        If there is a very long URL, such as a link to a github document, the scrf.io domain can be used to create a short-url that will redirect to it.

        A good example is the SCRF calendar. 

        Short-url is `scrf.io/calendar`

        Which redirects to `https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=null@scrf.io&ctz=America/Los_Angeles`        

        #Useage
        Sharing links on social media such as twitter.
        Provide easy to follow URLs for presentations.
